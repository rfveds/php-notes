### HTTP Headers In PHP - Request & Response Headers
HTTP headers facilitate data exchange between clients and servers, categorizing requests and responses with essential information.

### Highlights
- 📡 HTTP Messages: Exchange data between clients and servers.
- 🏷️ Headers: Provide additional information about requests and responses.
- 🔄 Status Codes: Indicate the result of HTTP requests (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
- 🔒 Authentication: Headers manage user authentication and permissions.
- 🔄 Redirects: Location headers guide users to new URLs.
- 📂 File Downloads: Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers manage file downloads.
- ⚙️ Exception Handling: Properly manage errors with status codes and custom error pages.

### Request Headers
- 📥 Request Structure: Contains method, URL, and protocol version.
- 🏷️ Header Fields: Provide additional request information.
- 📦 Body Content: Includes data sent to the server (e.g., form submissions).

### Response Headers
- 📤 Response Structure: Contains status code, message, and protocol version.
- 🏷️ Header Fields: Provide additional response information.
- 📦 Body Content: Includes data sent from the server (e.g., HTML content).

### Additional Notes
- `exit()` and `die()` functions can be used to terminate PHP scripts and prevent further execution after sending headers.
