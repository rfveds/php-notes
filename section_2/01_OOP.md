## OOP in PHP

### Classes and Objects
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
- An object is an instance of a class.
- A class is defined using the `class` keyword.
- An object is created using the `new` keyword.

```php
class Person {
    public $name;
    public $age;
}

$person1 = new Person();
$person1->name = 'John';
$person1->age = 30;
```

### Advantages of OOP
- Better code organization.
- Easier to maintain and update.
- Modularity.
- Reusability.
- Polymorphism.

### Main OOP Concepts
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit.
- **Inheritance**: A class can inherit
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to present the same interface for different data types.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
