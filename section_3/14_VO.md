### Value Objects (VOs) in PHP

#### Overview of Value Objects (VOs)

- **Definition**: Small objects that represent simple entities whose equality is based on their values, not identity.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - **Immutable**: Cannot change once created.
    - **Valid by Default**: Always in a valid state upon creation.
    - **Side-Effect Free**: Any method that changes data returns a new instance.

#### Use Case Example: Shipping Cost Calculation

- **Scenario**: Calculating the shipping cost based on package dimensions and weight.
- **Billable Weight Calculation**:
    - Uses either **dimensional weight (dim weight)** or **actual weight**, whichever is higher.
    - Dim weight is calculated as `(width * height * length) / dim divisor`.

#### Issues with Basic Implementation

- **Invalid Data**: Negative dimensions, zero dim divisor can lead to errors or incorrect calculations.
- **Validation Challenges**: Hardcoding validation within the service class leads to cluttered and less maintainable
  code.

#### Refactoring with Value Objects

- **PackageDimension VO**:
    - Encapsulates `width`, `height`, `length`.
    - Ensures immutability and validity upon creation.
    - Handles unit conversion and validation within the object.

- **Weight VO**:
    - Encapsulates the `weight` value.
    - Validates the weight to avoid negative or unrealistic values.

- **DimDivisor Enum**:
    - Represents valid divisors for different carriers.
    - Prevents invalid divisor values.

#### Benefits of Using Value Objects

- **Encapsulation**: Validation and behavior are contained within the VOs, keeping the service class clean.
- **Simpler Method Signatures**: VOs reduce the number of parameters passed to methods.
- **Error Prevention**: Only valid data is passed around, reducing the risk of errors.

#### Comparison with Other Models

- **Entities**:
    - Identified by a unique ID.
    - Mutable, with properties that can change over time.

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**:
    - Simple containers for transferring data.
    - No behavior or logic.

- **Value Objects**:
    - Equality is based on properties.
    - Can have behavior and validation logic.
    - Always immutable and side-effect free.

#### Key Takeaways

- Use VOs when:
    - Additional information or validation is needed beyond simple scalar values.
    - Grouping multiple properties into a single, logical unit.
- Avoid using VOs when simple data transfer without logic is sufficient (use DTOs instead).

#### Practical Considerations

- Implement equality checks (`equalTo` method) for VOs.
- Keep VOs immutable to prevent unintended side effects.
- Use enums for static, predefined values to ensure valid states.

This approach enhances code maintainability, clarity, and robustness, especially in complex systems where data
consistency is crucial.
