### Covariance and Contravariance in PHP

Covariance and contravariance refer to how the types of parameters and return values of methods can vary in an inheritance hierarchy or with interfaces, especially when overridden methods are involved.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Variance in Type Systems**:
    - **Covariance**: Allows a method to return a more specific type than its parent method. For example, if a method in an interface or base class returns an `Animal` type, a subclass can override this method to return a more specific type like `Dog`.
    - **Contravariance**: Allows a method to accept a more general parameter type than its parent method. For example, if a method in a base class takes a parameter of type `AnimalFood`, a subclass can override this method to accept a more general `Food` type.

2. **PHP's Support for Variance**:
    - PHP supports covariant return types and contravariant parameter types starting from PHP 7.4. Covariant return types mean going from a less specific to a more specific type in return values, while contravariant parameter types mean going from more specific to less specific in method parameters.
    - Prior to PHP 7.4, attempts to use these variations would result in compatibility errors.

3. **Examples from PHP**:
    - Covariance example: A method in an interface returns a general `Animal` type, while a method in a subclass (e.g., `DogShelter`) returns a specific `Dog` type.
    - Contravariance example: A base class method accepts a parameter of a specific type (e.g., `AnimalFood`), and a subclass method overrides it to accept a more general type (`Food`).

4. **Unsupported Variances in PHP**:
    - **Covariant Parameter Types**: PHP does not allow parameter types to go from less specific to more specific in overridden methods. This would break type safety and Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).
    - **Contravariant Return Types**: Similarly, PHP does not allow return types to go from more specific to less specific.

5. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
    - This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
    - Proper use of covariance and contravariance aligns with LSP by ensuring type safety. If covariance was allowed for parameter types or contravariance for return types, it could break the LSP and lead to potential bugs.

6. **PHP Constructors and Variance**:
    - Constructors in PHP do not follow the same rules of covariance and contravariance. You can override a constructor in a subclass with different parameters without adhering to these variance rules, as long as you handle parent constructor calls properly.

7. **New Features in PHP 8.0 and 8.1**:
    - PHP introduced **union and intersection types** in 8.0 and 8.1. Union types allow for multiple acceptable types, while intersection types require a type to satisfy multiple interfaces or class types.
    - Using union or intersection types affects variance rules in a way similar to the basic covariance and contravariance rules.

8. **Implications for SOLID Principles**:
    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), one of the SOLID principles, is directly related to type variance. Proper application of variance ensures that LSP is not violated in code.

The video also hints at a potential series on SOLID principles for deeper exploration of topics like LSP and its role in object-oriented programming (OOP).
