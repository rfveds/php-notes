### Cron Job Basics

**Cron** is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It automates the execution of scripts or tasks at
specific times or intervals, without manual intervention.

### Cron Job Syntax

Each line in the crontab file represents a cron job and consists of two main parts:

1. **Schedule fields**: Define when the job runs.
2. **Command**: The script or command to execute.

```plaintext
*    *    *    *    *  /path/to/script
|    |    |    |    |
|    |    |    |    +----- Day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
|    |    |    +---------- Month (1 - 12)
|    |    +--------------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
|    +-------------------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------------------- Minute (0 - 59)
```

### Special Characters in Cron

- `*`: Any possible value (e.g., every minute, every day).
- `/`: Step value (e.g., `*/2` means every 2 minutes).
- `,`: List of values (e.g., `1,3,5` for minute 1, 3, and 5).
- `-`: Range of values (e.g., `1-5` for days 1 to 5).

### Common Cron Examples

- **Every minute**:
  ```plaintext
  * * * * * /path/to/script
  ```

- **Every hour**:
  ```plaintext
  0 * * * * /path/to/script
  ```

- **Every day at midnight**:
  ```plaintext
  0 0 * * * /path/to/script
  ```

- **Every Monday at 8 AM**:
  ```plaintext
  0 8 * * 1 /path/to/script
  ```

- **Every 2 minutes**:
  ```plaintext
  */2 * * * * /path/to/script
  ```

### Setting Up Cron Jobs

1. **Edit the crontab file**: Use the command `crontab -e` to edit your cron jobs.
2. **Add a job**: Add your cron expression and the command to be executed.
3. **Save the file**: Cron will automatically start running the jobs based on the schedule.

### Cron in Docker

When working with containers, cron can be set up within a Docker container:

- **Dockerfile Setup**: Install cron inside your container and copy your crontab file:
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM php:8.1-fpm-alpine
  COPY ./crontab /etc/crontabs/root
  RUN mkdir /var/log/cron
  CMD ["crond", "-f"]
  ```

- **Crontab File Example**:
  ```plaintext
  */2 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /path/to/script.php >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
  ```
  - This runs the script every 2 minutes and logs the output to `cron.log`.

- **Start cron in Docker**: Add a cron container to `docker-compose.yml` and start it with `docker-compose up`:
  ```yaml
  cron:
    container_name: cron
    build: ./docker/cron
    volumes:
      - ./src:/var/www
  ```

### Logging Cron Jobs

To log the output of your cron job, append the command with:

```plaintext
/path/to/script >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
```

This logs both standard output and errors to `cron.log`.

### Automating Background Tasks with Cron

Cron jobs are ideal for automating recurring tasks such as:

- Sending queued emails.
- Backing up databases.
- Generating reports.
- Clearing caches or temp files.
- Running maintenance scripts.

By scheduling cron jobs, tasks can be processed at regular intervals, minimizing manual intervention and ensuring timely
execution.
