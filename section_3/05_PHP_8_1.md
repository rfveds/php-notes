This video provides an overview of new features and backward-incompatible changes in PHP 8.1, including deprecations.
The speaker begins by explaining how to install PHP 8.1 using Docker, noting that the 8.1 FPM tag is not yet available
on Docker Hub, so the release candidate (RC6) is used instead.

### Key New Features in PHP 8.1:

1. **Array Unpacking with String Keys**:
    - In PHP 8.1, array unpacking supports string keys, a feature unavailable in PHP 8.0 and earlier versions.
    - Example: Combining two arrays with string keys will merge and overwrite the values like `array_merge()`.
    ```php
    $array1 = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
    $array2 = ['b' => 3, 'c' => 4];
    $result = [...$array1, ...$array2];
    print_r($result); // ['a' => 1, 'b' => 3, 'c' => 4]
    ```

2. **Enumerations (Enums)**:
    - PHP now natively supports enums, which offer a way to define a set of possible values for a variable, helping to
      prevent invalid values.
    - Enums are like classes but use the `enum` keyword and have "cases" instead of constants.
    - Enums can be type-hinted, providing more robust type safety.
    - Example:
    ```php
    enum Status: string {
        case PENDING = 'pending';
        case ACTIVE = 'active';
        case INACTIVE = 'inactive';
    }
    $status = Status::PENDING;
    
    ```

3. **Read-only Properties**:
    - Properties can be marked as `readonly`, meaning they can be set only once and not modified later.
    - This feature helps prevent accidental changes to object states and can reduce boilerplate code.
    - `readonly` properties must have a type declaration and cannot have a default value unless used with promoted
      properties in constructors.

4. **Intersection Types**:
    - PHP 8.1 introduces intersection types, which require a value to match all specified types. This contrasts with
      union types, where a value can match any of the types.

    - Intersection types allow a variable to implement multiple interfaces simultaneously, enforcing stronger type
      constraints. Previously, to achieve similar behavior, you'd have to create a new interface extending both
      interfaces.

5. **`never` Return Type**

- A new return type, `never`, indicates that a function or method will never return a value and will always end with an
  exit or an exception. If the function reaches the end without explicitly exiting or throwing an exception, it will
  cause a fatal error.

6. **`array_is_list()` Function**

- The new function `array_is_list()` checks if an array is a list. A list in PHP is an array with keys starting from 0
  and ordered sequentially. This function helps verify if an array meets these conditions, especially after operations
  like `array_filter()` that can disrupt the ordering of keys.

7. **First-Class Callable Syntax**

- PHP 8.1 introduces first-class callable syntax, allowing you to create closures from callables more concisely without
  using the `Closure::fromCallable` method.

8. **Using `new` in Initializers**

- PHP 8.1 allows using the `new` keyword directly in initializers (e.g., constructor parameters) to set default values
  for parameters. However, this is only allowed in initializers and not for defining class properties or constants.

9. **Final Class Constants**

- Class constants can now be marked as `final` to prevent them from being overridden in child classes, providing greater
  control over inheritance.

### Backward Incompatible Changes and Deprecations

- **Static Variables in Inherited Methods**: Static variables are now shared between inherited methods when they are not
  overridden.
- **PDO Changes**: Even with emulated prepared statements, returned integers and floats from queries will now be
  returned as native PHP types.
- **Deprecated Features**:
    - Implementing `Serializable` without `serialize()` and `unserialize()` methods.
    - Passing `null` to non-nullable parameters of built-in functions.
    - Implicit float-to-integer conversions that cause a loss of precision will trigger deprecation notices when strict
      types are not enabled.
