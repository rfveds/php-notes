# PHP Expressions and Introduction to Operators

## Expressions in PHP

1. Definition:
   - An expression is anything that has a value or evaluates to a value
   - PHP is an expression-oriented language

2. Types of Expressions:
   - Constants
   - Variables
   - Literal values
   - Function calls
   - Comparisons
   - Assignments

3. Examples of Expressions:
   ```php
   $x = 5;                 // 5 is an expression (literal value)
   $y = $x;                // $x is an expression (variable)
   $z = ($x == $y);        // ($x == $y) is an expression (comparison)
   $result = someFunction($x, $y);  // someFunction($x, $y) is an expression (function call)
   ```

4. Expressions in Control Structures:
   ```php
   if ($x < 5) {  // ($x < 5) is an expression
       echo "Hello";
   }
   ```

5. Key Points:
   - Expressions can evaluate to any data type (boolean, integer, float, array, object, etc.)
   - Almost everything in PHP is an expression
   - Expressions are the building blocks of more complex code structures

## Introduction to Operators

1. Definition:
   - Operators are symbols that tell PHP to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations

2. Examples of Operators:
   - Assignment operator: `=`
   - Comparison operators: `==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
   - Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

3. Operator Precedence:
   - The order in which operators are evaluated in an expression
   - Important when dealing with multiple operators in a single expression
   - Can lead to unexpected results if not understood properly

4. Key Points:
   - Operators work with operands to form expressions
   - Understanding operator precedence is crucial for writing correct and predictable code
   - Proper use of parentheses can override default operator precedence

## Moving Forward

- Upcoming topics:
  1. Detailed explanation of various operators
  2. Operator precedence rules
  3. Control structures (loops, conditionals)
  4. Functions
  5. Combining these concepts to create more complex and useful code

- Focus on understanding how to combine these building blocks to create effective PHP scripts
